# The Legality of Cannabis, by State, & its Relation to the Price of Marijuana and the Housing Market

**Project description:** This project explores the relationship between cannabis legality, prices, and the Housing Price Index (HPI) in U.S. states. Using state-level data on marijuana prices (2015, 2022) and state-level HPI data (1975 to 2021), analysis suggests that while marijuana prices tend to decrease as nationwide availability increases, price is not heavily correlated with legalization status. Notably, states that allow the sale of recreational cannabis experienced faster-growing HPIs from 2015 to 2022. States permitting recreational cannabis also had higher HPIs at the start of 2015. Further research is needed to prove causation beyond observed correlations.

## 1. Initial Questions
- **Primary Question**: Does the legality of cannabis affect its price in U.S. states?
- **Secondary Question**: Is there evidence of a correlation between marijuana prices and the Housing Price Index (HPI)?

## 2. Data Wrangling


## 3. Methods


## 4. Key Findings & Limitations


## 5. Future Work
